            <p>My name is Luca Amato and I am currently working as an Associate Contracts Manager in Amazon Web Services's (AWS) Worldwide Public Sector business.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I received my B.A. in Political Science with a History Minor from the University of California, Berkeley.
              At Berkeley, I developed an interest in understanding and navigating institutions.
              In particular, I am interested in the how the structure and history of government institutions informs the actions they take.
              In my senior thesis, I investigated the relationship the constituency size of lower house state legislature districts has with the political extremism of the legislators they produce.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Outside of school, I put rubber to the road with these interests in my work for the ASUC Student Advocate's Office in my role as Policy Coordinator and Director of the Financial Aid Division,
              where I led a division of 13 caseworkers who gave client-facing guidance to students facing every problem under the sun with affording the college experience. In instances
              where policies lacked, I helped spearhead efforts to write whitepapers, grants, and other programs to help address the gap between Department of Education/University Policy
              and the experience on the ground.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              In my most recent position at AWS, I have had the opportunity to further pursue my interests in navigating government institutions.
              I currently support a team that handles AWS's work in the national security, education, non-profit, federal, state, and local government sectors.
